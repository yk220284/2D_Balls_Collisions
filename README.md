# 2D Balls Collisions
See it in action [here](https://yk220284.github.io/2D_Balls_Collisions.github.io/).

## Tools
Used Node.js and P5.js library to model Brownian motion with multiple features such as mouse and 
keyboard control for adding objects and tracking their movements. 
Implemented bootstrap and deployed on github.


## 2D Momentum Equations
The Maths behind the interactions between balls is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision).

## Areas of improvment
Authentic Brownian motion requires a lot more small balls, which however would result
in O(n^2) time complexity as each ball is checking all of the other balls' location.
